## Hi, I'm Shubham.
Welcome to my portfolio.

You can follow my [blog](https://shoobydo.substack.com) to find the data stories that I'm working on. You can also find me on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/vizfulthinking/) and [Twitter](https://www.instagram.com/vizfulthinking/)!

Below are some of the projects I've been working on, you can find the rest on my [GitHub](https://github.com/statxsphere/).

### Data Story: The impact of COVID-19 on Bengaluru's Air Quality ( [Code](https://github.com/statxsphere/aqi_bangalore/blob/main/Lockdown_AQI.ipynb) | [Blog](https://shoobydo.substack.com/p/the-covid-lockdowns-were-a-breath) )

**Skills used**: Time-Series Forecasting, LSTM Neural Networks, Geospatial Plotting, Hypothesis Testing (ANOVA).
**Data**: World Weather Online API, Kaggle and OpenBangalore.

*Summary*: 
* The trends and relationships between weather and air quality data in Bangalore were explored.
* Conducted hypothesis testing to check for statistically significant change in air quality before and after covid travel restrictions.
* Modelled a LSTM Neural Network to forecast Bangalore's Air Quality and contrasted forecasts made using pre and post travel restriction data.

### Product: Anime Recommendation Engine ( [Code](https://github.com/statxsphere/anime) | [Website](https://share.streamlit.io/statxsphere/anime/explore.py) )
