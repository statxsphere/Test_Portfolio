**Skills used**: Time-Series Forecasting, LSTM Neural Networks, Geospatial Plotting, Hypothesis Testing (ANOVA).
**Data**: World Weather Online API, Kaggle and OpenBangalore.

*Summary*: 
* The trends and relationships between weather and air quality data in Bangalore were explored.
* Conducted hypothesis testing to check for statistically significant change in air quality before and after covid travel restrictions.
* Modelled a LSTM Neural Network to forecast Bangalore's Air Quality and contrasted forecasts made using pre and post travel restriction data.
