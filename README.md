**Skills used**: Time-Series Forecasting, LSTM Neural Networks, Geospatial Plotting, Hypothesis Testing (ANOVA).

**Data**: World Weather Online API, Kaggle and OpenBangalore.

*Summary*:
* Data was sourced using an online API and Kaggle.
* The trends and relationships between weather and air quality data in Bangalore were explored.
* Conducted hypothesis testing to check for statistically significant change in air quality before and after covid travel restrictions.
* Modelled a LSTM Neural Network to forecast Bangalore's Air Quality and contrasted forecasts made using pre and post travel restriction data.

### Product: Anime Recommendation Engine ( [Code](https://github.com/statxsphere/anime) | [Website](https://share.streamlit.io/statxsphere/anime/explore.py) )

**Skills used**: Clustering, PCA, Cosine Similarity, Deployment Via Streamlit, Tableau, Photoshop.

**Data**: Kaggle.

*Summary*: 
* Exploratory data analysis was conducted to understand the drivers and trends in anime viewership.
* AniMap was made, which is a plotly treemap that can be used to explore the dataset visually.
* The recommendation engine: Anime Scout was developed, which can be used to generate recommendations out of previously watched anime.
* Both the aforementioned were deployed using Streamlit.

### Data Story:  NBA Draft 2021 Analysis ( [Code](https://github.com/statxsphere/nba_draft) | [Blog](https://shoobydo.substack.com/p/nba-draft-2021-an-analysis) )

**Skills used**: Web Scraping, Object Oriented Programming, Averaged Regression Models, Classification, Tableau.

**Data**: Scraped from tankathon.com, nba.com and basketball-reference.com using bs4 and selenium.

*Summary*: 
* Data was scraped from Tankathon (pre-draft stats), Basketball Reference (nba stats), and nba.com (advanced stats).
* The features were explored to determine what makes a good draft pick.
* Averaged regression models were used to predict which player from the current draft class could be the best.
* Classification was used to explore possible player archetypes.
